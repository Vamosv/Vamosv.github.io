#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Andrea Yaoyun Cui is a PhD candidate in Psychology at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where she has also completed an MS in Applied Statistics, and she is finishing an MCS in Computer Science in Fall 2025. Her research focuses on understanding visual search strategies through the use of eye-tracking and computational modeling techniques. She has conducted studies on conjunction search tasks, revealing how the visual system processes search displays and how participants adopt specific search strategies. Additionally, Andrea is skilled in applying statistical and computational methods to psychological research, bridging the gap between these disciplines to advance the understanding of cognitive processes.
